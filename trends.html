        <h4>Modern Trends in Version Control</h4>
    
    <p>Version Control has got new practices and integrations in recent years. For example:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>GitOps: Version Control Meets DevOps</li>
        <p>GitOps, which was introduced in 2017, treats infrastructure configuration as code stored in Git. Changes are made through commits to files , which automatically trigger deployment processes.GitOps is essentially an extension of DevOps practices. DevOps aims to bridge
development and operations through automation and collaboration.</p>
        <li>Integration with CI/CD Pipelines</li>
        <p>Continous Integration (CI) - catches integration issues, when code is changed in the main branch</p>
        <p>Continous Delivery/Deplyment (CD) - After integration and testing, the pipeline can
automatically deliver changes to staging or production environments. If deployment fails, it is possible to deploy a previous version of a deployment</p>
<p> CI/CD turns every code commit into a potential release â€“ and version control systems
provide the backbone to make that possible, ensuring each change is trackable, testable, and
deployable.</p>
    </ol>
    <li>Cloud-Based Version Control Platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)</li>
    <p>Another important trend is the use of cloud-based platforms for hosting. This platforms have features like: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>easy collaboration - provide web interfaces where you can review code, comment on
specific lines, and discuss changes</li>
        <li>issue tracking and project management - integration of issue trackers lets teams link code
changes to bug reports or feature requests</li>
        <li>continous integration services - CI tools integrate tightly with repos</li>
        <li>social coding - it's like a virtual portfolio for developers</li>
        <li>access control with integration - Cloud VCS platforms handle user access and integrate with other services, such as deployments or notifications, creating a connected ecosystem around code.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The role of AI in code Management and Review</li>
    <p>AI in code management is about automation and augmentation: automating repetitive tasks
(like scanning for known vulnerabilities in every commit) and augmenting developer capabilities
(providing smart suggestions). The aim is to improve code quality and developer productivity. For example, AI make the whole process of debugging code.</p>
