    <h3>Centralized and Cistributed Version Control</h3>
    <h4>Centralized Version Control</h4>
    <p><b>Centralized Version Control (CVCS)</b> uses a single central repository that stores the official code. Developers commit and pull changes from this server, requiring network access. While it’s simple and provides one source of truth, it creates a single point of failure and makes merging multiple developers’ changes more difficult.</p>
    <h4>Distributed Version Control</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Distributed Version Control (DVCS)</b>, used in systems like Git or Mercurial, gives each developer a full copy of the repository with its history. Changes can be committed locally and shared later, allowing offline work and providing redundancy. Merging and branching are built-in, supporting flexible, non-linear workflows. A central repo can exist by convention, but it’s not technically required.
    </p>
    <h3>Major VCS Tools and Their Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>RCS - used by individual developers or small projects needing versioning on single files</li>
        <li>CVS - usde for small-to--medium team projects, that need basic collaboration</li>
        <li>Subversion - used for projects needing a more robust central VCS than CVS</li>
        <li>Git - used from individual projects to the largest opensource endeavors</li>
        <li>Merculiar - was designed for performance and easy use with a DVCS model</li>
    </ul>
